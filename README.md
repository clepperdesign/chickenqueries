# chickenqueries
Experiments with databases (and chickens)
<br>
using a data series (featuring chickens) to test basic database queries. <br>
<br>
8/12/19: Program successfully returns database entries for a set parameter. Still very basic<br>
8/13: Program allows you to sort based on a few more features. Added more data to database, no filters yet for it.<br>
8/13: Program filters through four different criteria, allowing you to filter based on one to four of them. <br>
To do: look up entry by name
